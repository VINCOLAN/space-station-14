 You might think that clowning is your job now, but Clowning is more than just a job it's a life-style, if you want to start on this path I will give you the best head start with 5 advices.

 1. Block Hallways with Performance Art!
 Why it’s Artistical (AND legal):
 Space Law prohibits vandalism that damages station property , but says nothing about "temporary art installations." Welder-tank piles, banana-peel mosaics, or welded barricades labeled "CLOWN ZONE" are legally defensible as "cultural expression." If Security tries to dismantle it, scream "CENSORSHIP!" and demand a warrant for departmental searches . If arrested, your sentence caps at 5 minutes for "petty vandalism" and plenty of time to plan your next art show!

 2. Spike Drinks with Non-Lethal Funnies to Enhance Comedy!
 Why it’s Delicious (AND legal):
 Space Law bans mindbreaker toxin and space drugs(BORING) , but ignores "mild" chemicals like Mute Toxin (silences victims) or Ipecac (induces vomiting). Spike the bartender’s supply, then document the "hilarious" results. Since you’re not targeting individuals (just the whole bar), Security can’t charge you with poisoning without witnesses. If caught, claim you were "testing beverage innovation"! maximum sentence is 10 minutes for "possession of restricted substances".

 3. Exploit Medical ‘Self-Treatment’ for Chaos!
 Why it’s Medically not safe (AND legal (maybe)):
 Steal medical stimulants (e.g., Ephedrine) to run 200% faster. If caught, claim you ‘need them for clown ADHD.’ Medical staff can’t deny treatment for self-diagnosed conditions!

 4. Cover EVERYTHING with funny glue!
 Why it’s Sticky (AND ABSOLUTELY legal)
 Get a toy-box from cargo with all the funny glue you can put on your backpack, after that go around putting funny glue on any minor contraband and giving it to sec or mail boxes you can find glue them and deliver it to the nearest department! Toy boxes are your job gear! they cannot charge you for working on you hard earning job nor take it from you for no reason!

 5. "Accidentally" Deploy slippy things in Security Hallways!
 Why it’s Slippy (AND ABSOLUTELY legal)
 A master trick is knowing what tools you can use on the job, for slipping use the common and handy soap or banana peels or your clown pda maybe?! OR EVEN THIS BOOK! if you can make them slip you just trow on the exits of sec and wait to the sec slipping begins, extra funny if you can get space lube to put on the whole sec hallway! And if you get caught just blame the nearest mime or say that it slipped out your hand!

 "Space Law isn’t about justice, it’s a checklist. Tick enough boxes while holding a squeaky flower, and you win."
 — Silly Billys Clowney Jr, before being spaced by an angry mob.
