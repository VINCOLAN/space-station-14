 You might think clowning is just your job now, but clowning is more than just a job – it's a lifestyle! If you want to start on this path, I'll give you the best head start with 5 pieces of advice.

 1. Block Hallways with Performance Art!

 Why it’s Artistic (AND Legal):
 Space Law prohibits vandalism that damages station property, but says nothing about "temporary art installations." Welder-tank piles, banana-peel mosaics, or welded barricades labeled "CLOWN ZONE" are legally defensible as "cultural expression." If Security tries to dismantle it, scream "CENSORSHIP!" and demand a warrant for departmental searches. If arrested, your sentence caps at 5 minutes for "petty vandalism," giving you plenty of time to plan your next art show!

 2. Spike Drinks with Non-Lethal Funnies to Enhance Comedy!

 Why it’s Delicious (AND Legal):
 Space Law bans mindbreaker toxin and space drugs (BORING!), but ignores "mild" chemicals like Mute Toxin (silences victims) or Ipecac (induces vomiting). Spike the bartender’s supply, then document the "hilarious" results. Since you’re not targeting individuals (just the whole bar), Security can’t charge you with poisoning without witnesses. If caught, claim you were "testing beverage innovation"! The maximum sentence is 10 minutes for "possession of restricted substances".

 3. Exploit Medical ‘Self-Treatment’ for Chaos!

 Why it’s Medically Unsafe (AND Legal (Maybe)):
 Steal medical stimulants (e.g., Ephedrine) to run 200% faster. If caught, claim you ‘need them for clown ADHD.’ Medical staff can’t deny treatment for self-diagnosed conditions!

 4. Cover EVERYTHING with Funny Glue!

 Why it’s Sticky (AND ABSOLUTELY Legal):
 Get a toy-box from Cargo with all the funny glue you can carry. Put it in your backpack, then go around applying funny glue to any minor contraband. Give glued items to Security or mailboxes! Toy boxes are your job gear! They cannot charge you for working hard at your job, nor take it from you without reason!

 5. "Accidentally" Deploy Slippy Things in Security Hallways!

 Why it’s Slippy (AND ABSOLUTELY Legal):
 A master trick is knowing what tools you can use on the job. For slipping, use common and handy items like soap, banana peels, your clown PDA, maybe?! OR EVEN THIS BOOK! If you can make them slip, just toss your tools near the Security exits and wait for the slipping to begin. Extra funny if you can get space lube for the whole Security hallway! And if you get caught, just blame the nearest mime or say it slipped out of your hand!

 "Space Law isn’t about justice, it’s a checklist. Tick enough boxes while holding a squeaky flower, and you win."
 — Silly Billy Clowney Jr., before being spaced by an angry mob.
